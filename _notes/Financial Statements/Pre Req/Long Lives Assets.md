- Getting item ready for its intended use IE shipping, insurance to get it there is included in cost


Expense VS Capitalize:
Expensing a cost indicates it is included on the income statement and subtracted from revenue to determine profit. Capitalizing indicates that the cost has been determined to be a capital expenditure and is accounted for on the balance sheet as an asset, with only the depreciation showing up on the income statement.



If you make interest money on a loan you are borrowing, GAAP does not require you to take it into account. IFRS does. 
Example:

- Capitalized:
  Non-Current Assets rise
  Cash Flows from investing go down

Depreciation:

- Double Declining
  Take straight line and double the amount you would take from the carrying amount 
  Depreciated down to salvage value

- Units of Production
  Depreciation Expense = Depreciation Cost(Period Production/Capacity)
  - For this you do cost - salvage for depreciation cost then for each period you multiply the ratio by the original cost

Component Method of Depreciation:
- Required under FRS
- Allowed under GAAP (Rarely Used)
- If components cost is significant in relation to total cost and or with different useful lives

Impairment: Unanticipated decline in the value of an asset

- Reversals allowed with IFRS only
- Impairment charge reduces net income
- carrying value of asset decreases
- no effect on cash flows (non cash change)
