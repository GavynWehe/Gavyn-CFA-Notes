Cost of Inventories:

- FGI - Finished goods inventory 
- Period Costs: Non inventoriable costs

Inventory Valuation Methods:
![](https://i.imgur.com/YJbdSTn.png)
- Specific ID = Jewelry stores, each unit has own value
- FIFO = First in first out, oldest units sold first - COGS
  -Newest units in inventory - Ending inventory (EI)
- FIFO with inflation prices go up the lower cost inventory is being sold but the higher cost is in inventory


![](https://i.imgur.com/r3Fp3cp.png)
- Weighted average cost (AVCO): costs allocated evenly across all units for sale
- LIFO = Last in first out (GAAP ONLY)
  Newest units sold first for COGS
  Oldest units stay in EI
- Periodic Inventory System- Inventory on hand calculated periodically
- Perpetual inventory system- updated continuously (What is used now with computers)

- LIFO and FIFO are different based on if cost of goods is increasing or decreasing year to year


Example 3: Perpetual vs Periodic

- LIFO with perpetual have to look to see what inventories you even have available at the time to use for LIFO.
- If you dont have the inventory yet and you continuously check inventory then you can only use whats on hand


Constant or increasing inventory levels:

If unit costs are increasing:
COGS: LIFO > AVCO > FIFO
 -If COGS is getting much higher,Â **it means your gross margins may be tight and you might end up operating at a loss**
EI: FIFO > AVCO > LIFO
 -EI higher means higher asset value

If Unit costs are decreasing:
COGS: FIFO > AVCO > FIFO 
 -FIFO Leads to lower profitability
EI: LIFO > AVCO > FIFO
 -LIFO leads to higher asset values


Example 4: Inflation impact on LIFO vs FIFO

- Whole example is to say you need to have a LIFO to FIFO conversion to compare across companies.
- FIFO looks like they are less efficient in inventory turn over because the cost of their inventory is increasing year to year while LIFO stays constant
- LIFO reserve and LIFO Liquidation


LIFO Method:
![](https://i.imgur.com/VdcBJl7.png)
- If a company's industry has decreasing prices its doubtful they will use LIFO (Gives a higher tax bill)

LIFO Reserve:
![](https://i.imgur.com/LaYkNql.png)
- Changing a company from LIFO to FIFO
- Typically the LR (LIFO Reserve) > 0
- FIFO t1 - LIFO t1
- FIFO = LIFO + LR
- LR May increase over time if:
  Prices are Rising
  Quantities added to inventory > quantities sold


Lifo Liquidation:
![](https://i.imgur.com/p5VXtgQ.png)
- Quantity of units sold > Quantity of units added to inventory
- Some of the older units in inventory are sold 
- Makes it look like very low COGS relative to other years for better (Larger) margins

Example 5: Inventory conversion from LIFO to FIFO
![](https://i.imgur.com/Iru7MMb.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/q86mW0w.png)
- LR and declining inventories show LIFO liquidation
![](https://i.imgur.com/5jdTJq4.png)
- Just add what is given in the notes to the inventories given
![](https://i.imgur.com/vPmBwvj.png)
- Subtracting a negative so you add
![](https://i.imgur.com/9MEKrjc.png)
- Reduction in taxes on decreased operating profit

- Use this example to cement how to go from LIFO to FIFO
