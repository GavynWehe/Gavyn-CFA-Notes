Deferred Revenue:

- Advanced payments are not yet earned so they do not appear on the income statement instead we do deferred revenue on the balance sheet (As a liability) and the cash goes on the CFS

- All of Direct is looking for changes year to year from the Balance sheet, then comparing and deduct or adding back into the income statement number


Indirect Method:
![](https://i.imgur.com/yj8zfuJ.png)
- Instead of disclosing cash flows by the type, CFO is calculated by adjusting Net income because Net income includes non cash transactions
- If you have an increase in net income you need to subtract it out
- If you have a reduction in net income you need to add it back in



Indirect Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZZbItUE.png)
- Indirect is the most common way
- Get net income from income statement
- Go to balance sheet to adjust it accordingly 
- Depreciation is classic non cash charge, get that from income statement 
- Gain from sale of equipment is included because that goes on CFI not CFO
- Land, buildings, equipment, and long term assets are set to CFI dont include

Cash Flows from Financing Activities (CFF):

- Remember the additions and deductions


![](https://i.imgur.com/Z4jTxAS.png)
- Indirect start with net income
- Do opposite for NI


![](https://i.imgur.com/oxdAiRC.png)
- First you need to find Net income
- To find you take RE from previous year compare it to next year and add or reduce dividends
- From there find what the difference is and get the NI 
- Take the NI and add or subtract cash flows from operations
- Lastly you add back depreciation


![](https://i.imgur.com/rntGPDW.png)
- Same thing find deductions after depreciation 


![](https://i.imgur.com/YI1hTfH.png)
- Same idea, this time make sure when you are looking at COGS its from the current year, you dont do the difference between the years you subtract the whole number


![](https://i.imgur.com/4zg4pba.png)
- COGS is adjusted with inventory and accounts payable
- Dont worry about total assets increased by
