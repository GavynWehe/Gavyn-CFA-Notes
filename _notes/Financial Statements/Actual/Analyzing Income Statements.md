Revenue:

- Can only be recognized (Shown in Accounts) when earned:
- Earned means Risk and Rewards are transferred to the consumer

- Principal means they control the product before the goods are transferred to the costumer. Its their product they have it in their warehouse
- Agent does the transfer for a third party
- This can affect the income statement to show a better net profit margin 


Long Term Contracts:
![](https://i.imgur.com/lU9oh1P.png)
- Rules to be paid out above
- Example has as you get certain % of the way finished you get that % of revenue 


Bill and Hold Arrangements:
![](https://i.imgur.com/IIZY6fK.png)
- Customer doesnt have physical possession but you can still show revenue 
- Rules listed above 


Expenses:
![](https://i.imgur.com/64mnZ8r.png)
- Matching: You must match expenses to revenues
  Inventory
  
- Expenses as Incurred: Period costs
  Admin and Payroll
  
- Capitalization and Subsequent Depreciation or Amortization: Spreading out expenses over a set amount of years
  Tangible is depreciation, Intangible is Amortization


Examples:


Inventory:

Capitalizing VS Expensing:
![](https://i.imgur.com/9PaXvL5.png)
- CFO = Net income + Depreciation
- Shows the differences between depreciating an asset vs expensing it at the start

Capitalizing an Ongoing Purchase:
![](https://i.imgur.com/kQmphQD.png)
- Once the Depreciation is = to the expensing cost you have no impact on profits
- Depreciating an asset will make you pay less taxes year over year but will eventually equal what you pay when you expense. 
- The expense just hits the account harder at the start of the year you purchase it

Expenses: Interest
![](https://i.imgur.com/conmbVh.png)
- Capitalize means send to the B/S
- Table shows where interest expenses show up on the B/S, IS, and CFS


Example:

Effect of Capitalized Interest Costs on Coverage Ratios and Cash Flow:
![](https://i.imgur.com/28VRwpl.png)
- Capitalized interest isÂ **the cost of borrowing to acquire or construct a long-term asset**. Unlike an interest expense incurred for any other purpose, capitalized interest is not expensed immediately on the income statement of a company's financial statements.

- Expensing VS Capitalizing: 
- Expensing a cost indicates it is included on the income statement and subtracted from revenue to determine profit.
- Capitalizing indicates that the cost has been determined to be a capital expenditure and is accounted for on the balance sheet as an asset, with only the depreciation showing up on the income statement.




Big Example: Capitalizing VS Expensing on ratios
![](https://i.imgur.com/BZRJ7I3.png)
- Amortization is not a cash flow so you do not need to account for it when doing adjusted CFO, just subtract capital expenditures

- You need to account for amortization when adjusting for CFI, you will add back on amortization and subtract capital expenditures

- Divide those numbers by shares outstanding to get them on a per share basis when doing ratios of price of stock to whatever

- EV = Enterprise Value = Market price x Shares outstanding

- Operating income = EBIT

Non Recurring:

Non Recurring:
![](https://i.imgur.com/oAUlvMw.png)
- Discontinued operations: Disposed of or established plan to dispose of a component operation


Earnings Per Share:
![](https://i.imgur.com/mEm1WRo.png)
- Per share = Ordinary Shares (IFRS) or Common stock/shares (US GAAP) they are interchangeable
- Financial instruments that are potentially convertible to common stock have the potential to dilute EPS


EPS:
![](https://i.imgur.com/kuN4tKg.png)
- Basic EPS Formula = (Net income - Preferred dividends) / (Weighed average # shares outstanding)


Example:


Basic EPS Calculation with Stock Split:
![](https://i.imgur.com/VfcnXbt.png)
- When doing weighted average multiply current amount by how many months in between the change /12
- For a stock split for comparability you assume it was at the start of the year 


Diluted EPS:
![](https://i.imgur.com/ndpILgn.png)
- Same as previous formula but you add the savings on top and add the shares issued on the bottom


Example with convertible preferred stock:
![](https://i.imgur.com/fsNHM0V.png)
- Diluted EPS will always be lower than basic if diluted is higher than basic you did it wrong or were looking at anti diluted securities which you ignore.

Treasury Stock Method:
![](https://i.imgur.com/WI9LKqM.png)
- Assumptions:
  - All dilutive options/warrants have been exercised
  - Company uses exercise proceeds to repurchase as many shares as possible at the average market price for the period 
  - Add net number of shares to the denominator of basic EPS

Treasury Stock Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/gjxTC6E.png)
- Find out what the market price would be and what we can purchase
- Divide that # by the average market price
- Add that to the denominator 



Anti Dilutive Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/HCD9kxC.png)
- With anti dilutive you report the diluted EPS so if you get a question look out for the original EPS as well


Ratios and Common Size Analysis:
![](https://i.imgur.com/sHZ7T03.png)
- Each line stated as a % of sales
- Removes the effect of size
- Useful for cross sectional/time series analysis


Memorizing Ratios:
- Make a card with the numbers and the ratio you need to calculate and then have the answer on the back

- Not the principal so they can only do commissions as their revenue 


![](https://i.imgur.com/wLWW106.png)
- If you go from expensing to capitalizing initially your profitability will look higher


![](https://i.imgur.com/wLXuJNt.png)
- Didnt discontinue if they did they would say. If it burned they may report it elsewhere 


![](https://i.imgur.com/k1KWIKk.png)
- Change an estimate you adjust forward
- Change policy you need to restate current and prior numbers


![](https://i.imgur.com/j4gKe4u.png)
- Only subtract preferred dividends
