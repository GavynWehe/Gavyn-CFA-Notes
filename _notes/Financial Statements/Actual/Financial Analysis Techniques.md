Ratios:
![](https://i.imgur.com/8n8ElHQ.png)
- Vertical Common Size 
  B/S = % of total assets
  I/S = % of total revenue
  CFS = % of revenue or % cash inflow / outflow
- Horizontal Common size = % of same item from base year
- Cross sectional analysis: Specific metric for one company vs another


Categories of Ratios:
![](https://i.imgur.com/i5cduOA.png)
- Not just calculate them, you need to be able to interpret them.
- Most of the questions will give you the ratio you need to know what it means 

- Activity Ratios how efficiently you use your assets
- Liquidity Ratios ability to meet short term obligations (Current section)
- Solvency Ratios ability to meet long term obligations (Debt VS Equity)
- Profitability Ratios ability to generate profits from its resources (Net Margin)
- Context is King: Need to compare to something else and know the context, they are a social animal 



Activity Ratios:
![](https://i.imgur.com/7dtxdzb.png)
- Inventory Turnover: How many times did you turnover your inventory during the period
- Days inventory on hand (DOH): On average how long does inventory stay in your warehouse 
- Higher Turnover ratios = more efficient = lower DOH ratio

- Receivables Turn Over: How many times do you collect your receivables in the year 
- Days Of Sales Outstanding (DSO): How long does it take to get cash from your customers

- Payables Turnover: How often do you pay your suppliers during the year
- Number of Days of Payables: How long it takes you to pay your suppliers


Activity Ratios Interpretation:
![](https://i.imgur.com/GIWH41l.png)
- Inventory turnover: Check if revenue is growing with a high ratio, if its growing its a good sign. If revenue is declining then you could have poor inventory levels or had to throw inventory away
- Receivables Turnover: See if revenue is growing with it, if not could be losing out on revenue if you have too strict credit turns. Check receivables aging schedule if its drifting into older categories that can be bad
- Payables Turnover: If its high do you have bad credit terms and need to pay back sooner? Take advantage of discounts if you pay early. Compare to liquidity if you pay quickly and have huge cash balance maybe you are taking advantage of discounts

Activity Ratios Continued:

- Working Capital Turnover: Turnover it these means revenue, dollars of revenue per dollar of working capital. Higher means more efficient but industry is important
- Fixed asset Turnover: 
- Total Asset Turnover:


Activity Ratios Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/9gIEp5p.png)
- Just a calculation


![](https://i.imgur.com/BaKccf7.png)
- Days Sales Outstanding was getting bigger (Customers were taking longer to pay)
- Accounts over 90 days were getting larger as well
- Provision for impairment was going down not a good sign 
- Customers are getting less likely to pay and then they are holding less money for a provision




![](https://i.imgur.com/52TMOno.png)
- Total asset turnover = Dollar of revenue per dollar of assets
- DOH went down due to obsolete inventory which is not good, lowered inventory and made DOH look better even though it was a negative thing



Liquidity Ratios:
![](https://i.imgur.com/3OMDfCI.png)
- Ability to meet short term obligations:
- Current Ratio: Current Assets/Current Liabilities 
  Assumes Inventory, receivables, Cash
- Quick Ratio (Acid Test): Cash + Short Term Marketable investments + Receivables/Current Liabilities
  Does not take into account Inventory
- Cash Ratio: Cash + Short Term Marketable Investments/Current Liabilities
  Crisis Measure, most strict
- Higher Ratio = Higher Liquidity
- Lower = Reliance on CFO and outside financing 


![](https://i.imgur.com/bdW80z3.png)
- Defensive Interval Ratio: How long can the company pay daily cash expenses with existing liquid assets. 
  Higher = more defensive
  Higher = more costly, holding onto cash has costs

- Cash Conversion Cycle (Net Operating Cycle): Measuring the gap from the date you have to pay for your raw materials or goods and the date you collect cash from customers
  Longer cash conversion cycle is more expensive to finance



Liquidity Ratios Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FGFXRMw.png)
- Negative cash conversion cycle in a positive way


![](https://i.imgur.com/AeVNP0G.png)
- Negative cash conversion cycle in a negative way



Solvency Ratios: Ability to meet long term debt obligations
![](https://i.imgur.com/0XMm8iv.png)
- Debt Ratios: Higher = more risk
- Coverage Ratios: Higher = less risk
- Interest Coverage: Seeing if you can cover your interest payments
- Fixed Charge Coverage: Used to measure the risk quality of preferred dividends


Leverage Ratios:
![](https://i.imgur.com/KLA3tU0.png)
- Since they are both at a point in time (B/S) you can do total no need to do average
- Financial Leverage Ratio uses average because its used in DuPont Analysis



Profitability Ratios: Measures Return Earned During a Period
![](https://i.imgur.com/bYvHtoe.png)
- Tells you how much was lost due to, tax, interest, operating expenses, etc...



Examples:

- Look at the relationships between ratios



DuPont Analysis:
![](https://i.imgur.com/AZnWcqX.png)
- ROE = ROA x Leverage


DuPont Analysis:
![](https://i.imgur.com/KKMrcw7.png)
- ROE = Net Margin x Total Asset Turnover x Leverage
- Net Margin x Total asset turnover = ROA


Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/gQpurvS.png)




DuPont Analysis:
![](https://i.imgur.com/uSKSYLv.png)
- ROE = Tax Burden x Interest Burden x EBIT Margin x Total Asset Turnover x Leverage


Example:

Example:

- Interpret ratios you have not been taught, IE industry specific ones

- Algebra Problem, need to know formulas


![](https://i.imgur.com/a9cLjTo.png)



![](https://i.imgur.com/sY752pq.png)
- Activity = efficiency
- Liquidity = short term
- Solvency = long term


![](https://i.imgur.com/tIKxjNd.png)
- Cant tell liquidity from debt to equity ratio
- Can tell solvency from debt to equity
- decline in equity can mean, company is incurring losses, paying dividends greater than income, or repurchasing shares



![](https://i.imgur.com/e7DCOoG.png)
- Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities
- Higher current = more liquid
- Debt to Equity shows solvency



![](https://i.imgur.com/9IXC9er.png)
- Current Ratio = Revenue / AVG Assets


![](https://i.imgur.com/QmORXp4.png)
- Interest Expense use interest PAID/EXPENSE not total interest bearing debt




![](https://i.imgur.com/94ioiOB.png)
- Current Ratio does liquidity
- Interest coverage is solvency
- Debt to assets is solvency


![](https://i.imgur.com/u6lYk7u.png)
- Net margin is profitability
- Net Profit Margin = Net income / Revenue




![](https://i.imgur.com/1LYcuwb.png)
- Knowing how DuPont Works and the ratios to get to it.
- I could tell financial leverage increased but couldnt tell the net profit margin 



![](https://i.imgur.com/wVu2YTD.png)
- Net Margin = Tax Burden x Interest Burden x EBIT Margin
- Lower Tax burden = more paying in taxes think 1-t

- Leverage
