Measurement of Inventory:

- NRV = Net Realizable Value
- IFRS allows reversals US GAAP does not
- Write downs if inventory is damaged




Ratio Effects:

- Higher solvency ratios means more risk
- Write downs have a negative effect on ...
  Solvency Ratios
  Liquidity Ratios
  Profitability Ratios
- Write downs have a positive effect on Activity Ratios
- Write downs have no effect on quick/cash ratios because inventory is not included


Write Down Example:

- Net income is less than equity so on a write down it gets hit harder and will lower your ROE ratio



Effect of Inflation and Deflation:

Under Inflation:
- FIFO: 
  Higher profit on I/S
  Higher inventory on B/S
  Higher Taxes
- LIFO:
  Lower Profit on I/S
  Lower Inventory on B/S
  Lower Taxes
For Deflation Reverse everything



Presentation and Disclosure:

- IFRS does now allow LIFO 
- US GAAP does not allow reversals

- Can only go back up to cost under IFRS

- US GAAP no reversal

- Balance sheet inventory goes down
- Income statement COGS increases



![](https://i.imgur.com/rf2Eoa3.png)
- LIFO COGS is up to date
- FIFO COGS is older and out of date, cheaper

- FIFO uses older goods which are more expensive which raises your COGS and lowers your profit

- Inventory turnover is COGS in the year divided by average inventory

- FIFO and Specific Identification come out the same way with periodic system


![](https://i.imgur.com/BKDQpFa.png)
- Find out how much it changes by the write down to get back up to original cost
- Multiply the difference by ending inventory in that year

- LIFO to FIFO



![](https://i.imgur.com/aRzDXNN.png)
- Net income plus charges included in COGS(1-T)
- Divide by Revenues


![](https://i.imgur.com/ue6HP7Y.png)
- LIFO to FIFO Equity goes up because LIFO reserve is positive



![](https://i.imgur.com/Pn547kO.png)
- Current costs reflected would be LIFO
- From LIFO companies if LR went down then a LIFO liquidation happened, flooded thing with old costs

- LIFO + LR = FIFO
