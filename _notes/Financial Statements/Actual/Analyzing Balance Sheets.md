- IFRS on Intangibles
  - Research costs get expensed
  - Development costs get capitalized if... Feasibility, profitability, completion are met

- US GAAP - Expense both research and development


Goodwill:

- Arises on acquisition of one company by another
- Excess purchase price above fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities
- Capitalized and tested annually for impairment


Financial Instruments:
![](https://i.imgur.com/YayeygI.png)
- Contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another 
- Fair Value Profit and Loss:
  Realized and un realized losses in Income statement
- Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (OCI):
  Realized gains and losses on Income statement
  Unrealized G/L go on OCI
- Amortized Cost:
  Realized gains and losses on I/S
  Unrealized G/L not recognized

- Amortized Cost Method (US GAAP: Held To Maturity): Hold the asset to maturity, cash flows are on specified dates and consists of principal and interest only DEBT
- Fair Value OCI (US GAAP Available for sale): 
- Debt for US GAAP only, IFRS can have equity if they choose to and cant back down
- Business model is to collect cash flows and SELL the asset
- Fair Value through P/L (US GAAP Trading debt and ALL equity): If not in either of the other categories, or if made irrevocable election at purchase

Example:

- Makes sense, Amortization will not show up profit and loss
- Interest income is always listed on I/S for each method
- Difference is OCI doesnt show up on I/S but shows up on the balance sheet
