- Basically just doing time value of money 
- FV = PV(1+r)^t
- FV = PVe^rt
- Higher time, higher rate = higher futures price



Replication:

- Replication: Using borrowing/lending to buy/sell the underlying to replicate a forward contract (Or using a forward to replicate a cash transaction)

Cost of Carry:

- Net of costs and benefits related to owning the underlying for a specific period
- Use top formula for known amounts 
- Known RATES use continuously compounding formula


Example with Income:

Forex:

- Think of it as price/base
- Long a FX forward- Purchase the base at expiration and pay the price
- If you have base units and want price units you multiply
- If you have price units and want base units you divide



Forex and Commodities:

- If  rp - rb < 0: Forward price < spot price: Base trades at a discount 
  (OR price trades at a premium)
- If rp - rb > 0: Forward price > spot price: Base trades at a premium
  (OR price trades at a discount)
- Inverse commodity curve: Tight spot market, low storage costs, high convenience yield (Backwardation)
- Normal Curve (Upward sloping): Well supplied market, high storage costs, low convenience yield, all F(t) > So (Contango)
