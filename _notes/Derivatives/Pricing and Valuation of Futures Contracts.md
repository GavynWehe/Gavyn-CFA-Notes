Example:

- Mark to market is changed at the value of the futures price
- Spot price - PV of forward price = Forward value



Forward VS Futures:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FkOlMFc.png)
- Futures ft(T) changes every day
  Vt(T) = 0 at the end of each day, because it is settled everyday (Market to market)
- Interest Rate Futures: Long positions earn the fixed rate
  SO if you got it MRR at 1.75% and at expiration MRR goes to 1% you get the .75%xNA


Interest Rate Futures:

- Short positions Pay the fixed rate


Futures/Forward:

- Differences in valuation and pricing due to differences in cash flows
- Forwards and futures prices would be the same if...
  Interest rates are constant
  Futures prices and interest rates are uncorrelated



Futures/Forwards:

- Being long futures is the same as being short the FRA and vice versa

- Futures have forced liquidation with MTM
- Forwards dont need to worry about liquidity unless a central clearing or margin is required
- If this happens then futures and forwards prices are closer to each other
