- At expiration TV = 0
- TV always greater than 0
- Time value decays very fast in the last few weeks
- Time has value because gives more opportunities to add value to the option


Option Arbitrage:

- Magnitude of change at any price is approximated by its delta 



Exercise Price and Time to Expiration:

- Higher the stock price, higher the option value, higher the delta
- More time to expiration more convexity and higher the value of the option


Risk Free Interest Rate, Volatility, Income/Costs:
![](https://i.imgur.com/KkwFc1T.png)
- Increase in risk free rate = increase in calls and decrease in puts value
- More volatility = higher call and put values (Premiums)
- Income/Costs: Dividends/Income lower the call value but increase the put value because if it pays the dividend it opens lower and has to rise to the amount
  Costs increase call value but lower put value
