![[Pasted image 20240721151300.png]]
- Fiduciary Call: Long call with exercise price X, the present value of the strike price is invested in a risk free rate 
- Protective Put: Long the stock with a long put with exercise price X
- Both have the same payoff relationship is call put-call parity


Put-Call Parity:
![[Pasted image 20240721161411.png]]
- Given we have 3 variables we can always solve for the 4th 
- Assumption that they are European
- Have to be the same call and put strike price


Example:

- To price it correctly the strike prices have to be the same for the put and the call

- If you multiply them all by (-1) then you create synthetic shorts and so on

Application Credit Analysis:
![[Pasted image 20240721165005.png]]
- Value of the firm = Sum of its equity plus its debt
- Vo = Eo + PV(D)


Credit Risk:

- Can use put call parity on the value of the firm to come up with a value for what the credit spread will be

![[Pasted image 20240721171516.png]]
- Value of the firm to put-call parity
- PV of the strike turns into PV of debt
- Value of the stock price turns into value of the firm




![[Pasted image 20240721171724.png]]
- Forward Price = Spot(1+r)^t
- A lot of this is just re arranging the formulas
