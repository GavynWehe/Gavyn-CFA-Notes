Relating Swaps to FRA's:

- There has to be an easier way, IE swaps

- Receive Fixed, Pay Floating, Is the same as being long a fixed bond and short a floating bond
- Floating rate leg of a bond will always be a par bond

Swap:

- Swaps: An agreement to exchange a series of cash flows whereas a forward contract involves a single exchange
- FRA: Single payment at the beginning of an interest rate period
- Swap: Multiple payments that occur at the end of each interest rate period
- 3 Period swaps - one fixed rate
- 3 FRA's - 3 different rates
- A single 3 period swap is the same as 3 separate FRA contracts



Example of Swap Going Through Time:

- PV of payments = PV of payments received at the end if rates dont change

Example :

- If you receive the payment first in a swap you then have a marked to market loss for the future values

- Just showing relation with the curves.
- If rates decline then that would be positive for us the PV of the payments we need to MAKE will be lower thus getting a MTM gain on the swap

EOCQ:

- Both swaps are set to 0 at inception

- Forward starting swap (deferred or delayed start swap)
- Bad Question



![](https://i.imgur.com/CLr2Edg.png)
- If it was just time it would be B but since we dont know if rates changed we go with C

- Outstanding Fixed Rate debt means paying fixed
