- Both party have to have action in commitments
  no money changes hands day one (premiums)
- Contingencies only one has to act
- Forwards are OTC contracts
- Zero sum game, no wealth is created, only transferred 



Futures:
![](https://i.imgur.com/9onSZ1w.png)
- Exchange traded forwards, standardized, sizes, dates, underlyings
- Have daily settlement (Mark to market MTM) 
  If buy gains money its taken from sellers account and added to buyers at the end of the day
- Clearing house is counterparty to contracts

Price Limits and Swaps:

- Price limits: Contracts typically have daily price limits
- Circuit Breakers: Upper and lower limit to where prices can go. Have these because if volatility is crazy it trades off of the panic rather than the fundamentals 
- Swaps: 2 counterparties exchange a series of cash flows in the future
  One leg is floating - tied to a short term market reference rate that resets each period
  The other is fixed or tied to a different asset or rate


Swaps:

- Plain Vanilla: Fixed for floating


Swaps Continued:
![](https://i.imgur.com/V42sO2R.png)
- Pay Floating, received fixed - same as being short a floating rate and long a fixed rate
  This is a way to add positive duration to a portfolio because fixed rates have higher durations than floating rates
- Swaps are all OTC



Contingent Claims and Options:
![](https://i.imgur.com/4VYN5lt.png)
- Contingent claims: OTC or Exchange traded derivatives (ETD), Buyer (Long position) has the right to determine if delivery takes place
  All have a specific underlying, size, price, maturity date


Options:

- American options can exercise at anytime (Typically ETD), European options exercise at maturity only (Typically OTC)
- In the money will trade for at least its intrinsic value plus some time value

Credit Derivatives:
![](https://i.imgur.com/f1UHGa3.png)
- Based on the default risk of an issuer or group of issuers
- Credit Default Swap (CDS) are the most common
- If you are long a CDS you are short the credit quality, IE long the spread (Want it to get wider)

Forward Commitments VS Contingent Claims:
![](https://i.imgur.com/Sg9N6Oq.png)
- Because the forward doesnt pay any premiums, option long calls out perform long forwards on a decline in price since options have limited loss
- Long forward out perform long calls on gains because the option had to pay a premium to get into the contract
- Long forwards out perform short puts on gains since short puts only get the premium profit. However short puts out perform on losses because they gained the premium
