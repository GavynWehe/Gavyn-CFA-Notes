- To calculate CCC you need:
  Accounts Receivable
  Inventories
  Accounts Payable
  Sales
  Cost of Goods sold (COGS)
- DPO = Days payable outstanding
- DOH = Days of inventory on hand
- DSO = Days Sales Outstanding

- Keep in mind for CFO might need to reinvest into company

- Higher ratios = more liquidity
- Lower ratios = rely more on CFO (Cash flow from operations) or outside financing

Example:

- Ratios tell different stories
- Higher net working capital = better liquidity
