WACC Formula:
![](https://i.imgur.com/clh5NsK.png)
WACC = (Cost of debt x Weighting of Debt)(Cost of Equity x weighting of equity)

Examples:

- Take the weightings based off of the market value

- Objective: Minimize WACC
  Match liquidity/Time horizon with that CF capital investments
- Increase in tax rate decreases WACC

Higher operating leverage = more risk:

- Higher fixed costs = more risk

- More debt = more risk
- More debt = more financial leverage

- In a tax less world adding on more debt is perfectly offset by the increase in the cost of equity

- Adding on more debt lowers your WACC, 100% debt gives you the lowest WACC, however it has drawbacks such as, more risk, more operating costs, more fixed cost put towards the debt

- Cost of equity formula = 
  re = r0 + (r0 - rd)(1-t)D/E
- Value Levered Formula = 
  VL = Vu + t(D)
  t = tax rate 
  D = value of debt

- Cost of equity without taxes is higher than cost of equity with taxes

Pecking Order Theory:
![](https://i.imgur.com/4PZfS1q.png)
- Management has a preference for financing methods with the least potential information given to public
- Buy back shares, believe they are undervalued
- Issue more shares, believe they are overvalued

- WACC Example
- PV = CF/r for perpetuity
- Market Value = 
  MV = CF/WACC

![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1QKGz.png)
- VL = Vu + tD
- Ignore financial distress = that formula
- MM Situation



![](https://i.imgur.com/Wq4cosK.png)
- Same formula just subtract PV of distress



![](https://i.imgur.com/1aBE6fw.png)
- Once it gets to a certain point more debt hurts


![](https://i.imgur.com/ZaSQqcg.png)
- Use a bunch of formulas to get to the WACC
