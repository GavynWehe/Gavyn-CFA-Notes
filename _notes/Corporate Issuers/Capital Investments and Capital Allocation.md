- Amortization and depreciation are two methods of calculating the value for business assets over time. Amortization is the practice of spreading an intangible asset's cost over that asset's useful life. Depreciation is the expensing a fixed asset as it is used to reflect its anticipated deterioration.


Expansion of Existing Business:

Capital Allocation
![](https://i.imgur.com/WIicpOl.png)
- NPV is based on cash flows


NPV Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UPwql8s.png)
- Positive NPV increases value = invest
- NPV > =0 invest if less don't invest
- Necessary but not sufficient


NPV If there is a cash flow at half a year. Do 2x the periods:

IRR: Discount Rate that makes the NPV of an investment = to zero
![](https://i.imgur.com/z3VUR4s.png)
- If required return is < IRR you will get a positive NPV

XNPV and XIRR = excel uneven cashflows

Decision Rule:

NPV is better to base of compared to IRR, IRR does not take into consideration project $ cost

- The **capital turnover ratio** estimates the operating efficiency of a company via its allocation of equity capital. Expressed as a formula, capital turnover isÂ **the ratio between a company's net sales and the average shareholders' equity across a specified period**.

Real Options Decision Tree:

NPV Of an Option Formula:
![](https://i.imgur.com/Gj3R4sN.png)
- NPV with an option = NPV without - option cost + Option value

EOCQ:

- Only include incremental cash flows

- NPV IRR Decision Rule



![](https://i.imgur.com/vfnjsGy.png)
- Further into the future for cash flows = PV discounts more = PV decreases

- ROIC = Operating profit(1 - tax rate) / Average (LT debt + Equity)

![](https://i.imgur.com/4TeJMzC.png)
- Compare ROIC to IRR to see if its worth to invest
