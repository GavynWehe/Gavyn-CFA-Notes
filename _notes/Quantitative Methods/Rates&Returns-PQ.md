	[1.195)(.981)(1.197)(1.35)(1.057)]^1/5 -1 = .148968 = 14.8968%

	- Don't use the arithmetic because it is year over year. Arithmetic is only good for one year of averages. 
	- Geometric mean uses % return we dont have that.
	- Harmonic mean is good  between years

	- Geometric mean will never exceed the arithmetic mean.
	  Order goes: Harmonic < Geometric < Arithmetic
	- True, geometric mean measures compound rate of growth over multiple periods.
	- False the geometric mean does multiple periods.
	  PV(1+Rg)^n = FV

   - Geometric mean and time weighted are the same thing. 
   - Money weighted look to see there is much more invested on a year with a loss. Can do IRR and see answer

   - Same as above, committed more money on the year that got a lower return, therefore the money weighted rate of return would be less than the time weighted rate.

       Continuous Compounding Rate of Return Formulas: ln(1+r) or ln(Pt/Po))

        - Leveraged Return Formula: Rp + (VB/VE)(Rp-rd)
        - Rp = Return of the portfolio (%)
          VB = Value of borrowed $
          VE = Value of your Equity $
          rd = Debt cost %
          .1+(5M/20M)(.1-.06) = .11 11% (remember PEMDAS)

        - Return after the deduction of trading expenses but prior to the deduction of management fees custodial fees ect...

        - Gross return does not include trade expenses so you can ignore it.
        - Subtract the management fees from the gross return to get: 8.46-1.6 = 6.86 net return
        - From there use the leverage return formula
        - 6.86+ (2.5/7.5)(6.86-6) = 7.147% x (1-.3)(tax rate) = 5%
