3 Rules of Money:
1. Large CF's are worth more
2. Less risky are worth more
3. CF's sooner are worth more (TVM)

Compare Cash flows with PV (Present Value)

Formulas:

Future Value (FV): FV = PV(1+r)^t
Continuous Compounding FV = PVe^(rT)

Present Value (PV): PV = FV/ (1+r)^t
Continuous Compounding PV = FVe^(-rT)

**Fixed Income:**

Zero Coupon bonds: Sold at discount mature at par- Have a single CF at maturity

Coupon Bonds: Receive number of interest payments overtime and par at maturity

Fully Amortizing Bonds (Mortgage, auto loans): Investor receives level payments of both interest and principle  (Interest + Principle)

**Practice Questions: Zero Coupon Bond**

- PMT for Zero Coupon bond is = 0


**Practice Questions: Coupon Bonds:**

- If the coupon equals the YTM you will get a Par Bond: The PV will equal the FV
- YTM is higher than coupon you get a discount bond. Price is lower than FV 

**Perpetuity:** 
PV = PMT/r
**Annuity:**
Use TVM keys

**Practice:**

- Mortgages done monthly x 12
- To find interest payments in amortization table multiply the r/12 by the balance
- PMT - i = principle paying off 
- Subtract principle from the balance

**Equity- Pref Shares, Common Shares:**

- Constant dividend with no maturity = perpetuity: PV = D/r
- Constant Growth Dividend: PV = Do(1+g)/(r-g)
  For commercial Real estate: Property Val = NOI/(r-g).   NOI - Net opperating income
- Variable growth dividends: 2 stage model

**Implied Returns:**

- When calculating coupon bonds, find out the FV before you do the calculations
- Expected Annualized return:
- r = (FV/PV)^(1/t)-1

**Equity Growth:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/yHbpwmi.png)
- r = Do(1+g)/(PV) + g
  Do(1+g) is the same as D1
  PV = dividend yield
- g = r - Do(1+g)/PV
- PV/E =(Do/E)(1+g)/(r-g)
  E = Earnings
  This creates the P/E ratio

**P/E Ratio and Forward P/E:**

- When multiplying the bottom multiply both by 28 (problem 1)
- PV = Dt+1 for forward P/E

**Implied Forward Rates:**
(This section will be explained more in depth later, just getting surface level intro)


f(when,what)
- f3,4 
- forward rate that begins in 3 years and lasts 4

- Instead of using the FV of the prices, you can just use last years prices divided by current year and you will get the same information.
