- Easy and straightforward

- Homoskedasticity Definition: Constant variance

- Indicator variable: Yes or No, On or Off

- Look at T Stat value, see that is is greater than the one given so there is significance

- Need to know where to find what each of the variables are for the question and make the formula.
- Coefficient of determination is R^2
- Correlation between X and Y is Sqrt(R^2)
- Intercept is b0
- b1 is in front of what you are testing

- Cross sectional = looking at a point in time

- Standard error of the estimate explains the residuals from the regression
- The independent explains the dependent

- To tell if it is significant look at the t Statistic value and compared it to the two sided if the absolute value is larger then it is significant.

- Sample Covariance = ![](https://i.imgur.com/F7AnEPg.png)
- Then you divide by the degrees of freedom (n-1)

- Correlation = Sqrt(R^2)
- To find out if its a positive or negative sign look at the sign of the variable b1

- Hard to say causation from regression we can only observe so tend is a better word

- Using a t-test your degrees of freedom are n-2

- F statistic is equal to mean square regression divided by mean square residual

- Question 1

- Question 2
- If you get in the exam its a lot of work so save it for later
- If n is large you an almost assume that the standard error estimate will be the same as the standard error forecast, can substitute that in maybe as a shortcut
- Question 3 only observation 2, if xf is larger and Se is larger then Sf will be larger

- The dependent variable is not normally distributed, that would be the residual
- To find standard error of the estimate it is...
- Sqrt(MSE)
- To find MSE it is = SSE/n-2



![](https://i.imgur.com/H7HBYAY.png)
- For finding if you need to reject, take the variable you are testing and subtract it by the given value then divide by the standard error. If the result is less than the level of significance you fail to reject it
- Finding a prediction interval: y^ = +/- (t critical value x Standard error of forecast)

- To find the coefficient of determination if its not given = R^2 = Sum of squares regression/ TSS
- TSS = total sum of squares
- Standard error of the estimate = sqrt(mean squared error)
- When looking at log equations make sure to take the e^x at the end to get the correct answer
