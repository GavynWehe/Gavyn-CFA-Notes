- Uses T test statistic
- r(xy) = Correlation coefficient = (Cov(x1,y1))/((Sx)(Sy))
- Test Statistic = tn-2 = r(sqrt(n-2))/(Sqrt(1-r^2))
- The test statistic denominator is r^2 first then subtract by 1

**Non Parametric Test:**  Calculated on rank values and not the values of the observations of x or y
