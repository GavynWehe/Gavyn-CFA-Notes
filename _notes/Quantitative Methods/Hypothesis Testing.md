- Type 1 = False Positie
- Type 2 = False Negative
- Type 1 vs Type 2 Table![](https://i.imgur.com/JulXECH.png)

- Dont worry about python or R, not likely to be tested, know the Excel functions

**VIDEO HAS EXAMPLES OF TESTING THEM REWATCH THEM DUMBASS:**

- When would you use non parametric testing


**Seminar - Testing Means VS Testing Variances:**

- Testing Means, always use the T test it will always work. Unless... 
- sample <30, non normal
- If n <30 we can also use Z test
- Best way to find if its a one or two tailed test is to look at the alternative hypothesis, if its a not equals sign its a 2 tailed
- T test degree of freedom = n-1
- Two tailed test at 5% go to .025 on table
- Two tailed test divide alpha by 2

- T distribution is better because the values are wider, if you can reject a hypothesis with a T value you can clearly do it with a Z value

**Testing Variances:**

- Can only have a positive or 0 variance
- Chi Square test = x^2 = ((n-1)s^2)/Variance![](https://i.imgur.com/aOOZlgY.png)
-  Variance is distributed as a chi square variable 
- Means are distributed as a normal variable
- F test is the type of test just says take one variance over another. Larger variance is in the numerator

- Need to find both values it cant be a (+-) this is because it is bounded by zero unlike T or Z so there is no symmetry
- Variance is a measure of volatility
