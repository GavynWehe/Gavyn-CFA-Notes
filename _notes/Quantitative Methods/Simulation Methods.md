- From there get standard deviation from the variance
- Then find continuous compounding SD by multiplying SD by sqrt(250)

- Keep running the simulation 1,000 times, then you will get a normally distributed curve.
- The Monte Carlo Simulation gives you statistical estimates (Not exact results) of the probability that you will get x return in x years based on parameters
