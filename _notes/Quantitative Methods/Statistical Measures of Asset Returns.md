**Measures of Central Tendency:**

Arithmetic Mean, Median, Mode:

**Measures of location - Quintiles:**

Box and Whisker plots, IQR, Upper and lower bounds:![](https://i.imgur.com/dKXksdM.png)


**Dispersion - Variability around the central tendency, a measure of risk or uncertainty:**

Range, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Sample Variance, Sample Standard Deviation:

**Downside Deviation:**

Target Semi deviation, coefficient of variation

- For coefficient of variation lower numbers are better, there is less uncertainty or risk associated with it.


**Interpret and evaluate measures of skewness and kurtosis to address and investment problem:**

Normal Distribution: Most Common
A good starting point, it is well understood and have ways to calculate it. Once there is deviations from what is understood we can get information from it.
Mean = Median = Mode
Highest point is the mode
Median is always the middle

**Skew, Kurtosis, Leptokurtic, Mesokurtic, Platykurtic:**

You wont be asked to calculate Skew or Kurtosis, just understand what the formulas and results mean.
-.5 - .5 is "Good enough" for normalish enough
Closest to zero is best for skew and kurtosis.
For Kurtosis inside brackets trying to get to 3 hence subtracting 3

**Interpret Correlation Between Two Variables to Address an Investment Problem:**

Scatter Plot:

Useful for identifying outliers, visualize variation in two numerical values

Covariance:

Won't be calculating*
Joint probability of two random variables, expressed in the same units as the variables.

**Correlation: Measures the *linear* association between 2 variables:**

Sxy = Covariance
More commonly written as: Cov(xy)

r=0: No linear relationship (Max diversification)
r=1: Perfect positive correlation (Perfect replication)
r=-1: Perfect negative correlation (Perfect hedge)

Limitations:
- Linear association only
- Unreliable when outliers are present
- Correlation does not imply causation
