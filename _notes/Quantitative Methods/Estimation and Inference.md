**Systematic Sampling, Stratified Random Sampling:**

**Sampling Error:** Difference between observed values of a statistic and population parameters as a result of using just a subset of the population.
- Sample statistics are estimates of population parameters
- Not exact, therefore subject to error

- Standard Deviation (S) is a measure of dispersion, while standard error Sdx (= S/sqrt(n)) is a measure of precession
- **Cluster Sampling:** Divide population into clusters each of which is a mini representation of the clusters, pick clusters at random

**Central Limit Theorem:**

**As n increases, sampling error decreases.**

**Standard deviations are constant, if you increase n Sd will not change significantly like Standard error, thats why they are different**


**Resampling Continued Bootstrap Method:**

**Jackknife Method:** Drop one variable at a time leaving the others as the sample.

- More similar than bootstrap method because you are only leaving one variable out at a time, whereas the bootstrap can grab two completely different ones

**Seminar - Central Limit Theorem - Standard Errors VS Standard Deviation:**

- Z and T values can only be used in a normal distribution

![](https://i.imgur.com/8XCuHqR.png)
- Take means from multiple samples and plot them you will get a normal distribution

- Take the Standard deviation of the not normal population divided by n will give you the Sd of the new normal distribution

- Taking more and more means will just get it closer to zero and make the graph skinnier

- Standard error used when writing out a test statistic, confidence interval, using inferential statistics.
- Standard deviation used with descriptive statistics, sample size was this big, it had a mean of this, Sd of that. but once you test the mean and do a confidence interval its not the original population its the distribution of all of the sample means
