- Look to see where 10% is, 10% includes both 1 and 2

- Because the upper bound and lower bound were the same we take those
- Upper bound in lower percentile, and lower bound in higher percentile

- IQR = Upper bound in 25th percentile and lower bound in the 75th
  IQR = 75th - 25th or (3 - 1)

- (n+1)(y/100) = location for specific percentile 
- Find difference between 9th and 8th percentile
- Multiply it by .8 to find 80% between them
- Add to the 8th percentile to find answer

- Likely not going to need to calculate this because it will take too long on the test
- Fast way is to do 2nd 7 for data mode then enter data
- 2nd 8 for stat
- Scroll down to find Sx for standard deviation
- This will also give you the mean

- Get better at calculator work
- Target % = B
- Rule out all of the returns that were above 2%
