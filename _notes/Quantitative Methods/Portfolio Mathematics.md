**Calculate and interpret the expected value, variance, standard deviation, covariances, and correlations of portfolio returns:**

- Expected Portfolio Return:
- Variance Formula
- Co Variance Formula

- Variances are always >0 
- Covariances can be <0 or >0  (Also equal to)
**By Selecting assets with zero or negative covariance, portfolio risk is lowered, less correlation less risk (diversification)**
- Having a - covariance is not always a good thing. If the covariance is negative then you are removing risk, thus removing some return. -1 covariance is risk free rate of return you can get.  - covariance when one asset class' return is above its mean, then one is below its mean. Means wider the spread, assets with great returns then add a - covariance could be lower returns or even a - return. Closer to 0 is maximum diversification. As we get more - on correlation we change the portfolio return.


**Calculate and Interpret the covariance and correlation of portfolio returns using a joint probability function for returns:**

- Find E(x) of both R(A) and R(B)
- Subtract E(x) from R(A) and R(B)
- Multiply results by new R(A) and R(B) values
- Multiply by Probabilities of each scenario
- Add together

- Safety First Rules on Shortfall Risk: The risk a portfolio value or return will fall below some minimum acceptable level over some time horizon.
- Objective is to maximize this ratio
- Optimal portfolio minimizes N(-SFRatio)

**Seminar - Variances and Covariances in percent squared or decimals:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/j0mswWD.png)
- When dealing with variance and covariance matrix, they are in %^2, so you need to divide out by 10,000 to get the %

- Can use either form but if you do it in decimal form you have to move it over 4 places not two becase % ^2
