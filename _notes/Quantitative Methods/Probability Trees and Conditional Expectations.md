- When doing % multiplying remember to multiply by the (EPS - E(x)) ^2


**Formulate an investment problem as a probability tree and explain the use of conditional expectations in investment application:**

- Follow the branches, probability of X1 happening is the probability of it happening in Scenario S multiplied by the probability of S happening. Plus the probability of it happening in Scenario Sc multiplied by the probability of Sc

- Just take the probability of stock rising or staying the same multiplied by the given stock price in each scenario.

**Calculate and interpret an updated probability in an investment setting using Bayes' formula:**

**Bayes' Formula:** A method for updating prior probabilities based on new information.

- Find the expected probability of an outcome. From there divide the probability of the outcome happening by the expected outcome. This will give you the posterior probability (New probability given new information ie we now know the outcome)
