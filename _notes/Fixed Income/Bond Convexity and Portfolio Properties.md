Convexity Definition: Convexity is usedÂ **to measure a portfolio's exposure to market risk**. Convexity is the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields. Convexity demonstrates how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes.

Bond Convexity:

- Mod Dur: First order effect (Linear)
- Convexity: Second order effect (Option free bond)
- Convexity is a good thing: Price change in bonds if yields decrease is greater than a price change in bonds if yields increase




Calculation:

- To annualize convexity you need to do (Periods/yr)^2
- You need to because convexity is a ^2 term (time) (time)
- Fixed rate bonds will have greater convexity
- Longer time to maturity, lower coupon, lower YTM, all increase convexity
- IE anything that leads to higher mod dur for fixed rate bonds gives greater convexity

- Monthly has higher convexity than quarterly, which has higher than semi and so on

- Assumes only one change and nothing more

Annual Modified Duration:

- AnnModDur is - because interest rates and prices have inverse relationship
- Provides estimation of change in bond price given a change in its YTM

Approximate Modified Duration:

- Slope = (Change in y) / (Change in x)

- Use Effective Duration when you have a complex bond IE putable or callable 
- Uses changes in curve instead of yield

- Question was wrong had to re calculate

- Convexity adjustment is needed for the non linear relationship

- Because convexity is ^2 no matter the direction the change is greater with higher convexity

- For money convexity you just multiply by the dollar amount in the formula

- Multiply the weights by the AnnModDur and AnnConv to get portfolio numbers for them then use the formula as normal

- If duration is the same but convexity is greater you will out perform on both the way up and down
