- Buy and hold investors dont have to worry about 3

- Horizon Yield = (FV/PV)^1/t  - 1
- For the discount need to find the FV of coupons first with the investing horizon
- Then find the PV of the bond when you are going to sell it
- Add those two together to get FV and use horizon yield formula




Two Offsetting Types of Risk:

- Buy and hold only has reinvestment risk



Macaulay Duration (Mac Dur):

- The point in time where any reinvestment gain/loss is offset by any capital gain/loss for a one time instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve
- One time because we can only calculate it at a point in time it changes over time with time to maturity
- Duration Gap = Mad Dur - Investment Horizon



Calculating Mac Dur:

- Need a spreadsheet
- Quoted as a measure of time
- If it is semi annual to annualize it you need to DIVIDE by 2
- The Mac Dur can not be longer than the life of the bond

- Multiplying each CF's PV by its time to maturity and summing it all up

- Find FV of cash flows first then find PV of when you sell it add it together to get the FV and use horizon yield formula

- If Mac Dur > IH means its price risk dominant 
- If interest rates increase bond price goes down you lose money
