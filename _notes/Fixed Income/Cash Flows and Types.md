- Variable Interest Debt: MRR + Spread: Constant
- Fixed rate: Coupon is fixed, bond price moves
- Floating rate coupon moves, bond price stays the same
- Step up Bonds: Coupon rate steps up over time or is related to some event
  IE Credit Quality goes down, coupon payment goes up
  Issuer may be able to issue at a lower yield initially 
- Leveraged Loans: Loans to issuers of lower credit quality
- PIK (Payment in Kind) Bonds: Payment of i can be made by increasing the principal
  Will offer a higher yield

  If  Po (Equity) > conversion price: bond trades like a stock

Types Continued:

- Forced conversion clause: If Po > Conversion price for a # of days, company calls bonds at a lower price so you're forced to convert
  Do this so they dont continue to pay the coupon when you should convert
