Maturity Structure of Interest Rates:

- Spot Curve is for zero coupon bonds so there is no reinvestment risk
- A yield curve must reflect a group of bonds that is similar in all of their characteristics

Example:

- When doing ^3 or anything like that you need to press the y^x key
- Pulled towards final value because the biggest weight of cash flows is at the last PMT
- Easiest way to find par rate
  PMT = (1 - DFn)/(Sum(DF))



Forward Curve:

- Based on forward rates
- agreed on today, received/paid in the future
- Quoted as when what
  f(2,5) When? 2 years. What? 5 year rate
- Implied forward rates are calculated from spot rates



Forward Rate Examples:

- Keys to get to ^1/3 
- Number, multiply, y^x, 3, 1/x, enter
  can do this for any just replace the 3


Comparing Forward, Spot, and Par Curves:
![](https://i.imgur.com/RovjicS.png)
- Spot curve is in the middle
- On upward sloping forward is above the spot, par is below the spot
- On downward sloping par is above the spot and forward is below the spot
- Each of the forward rates are different thats why you cant cube the denominator

- Start with the in __ Years that is the starting point then add in the implied forward to that to get total

- Spot rates to forward rates

- When what quoting
- Look at the what and add them together to find what year spot rate

- All true

- If the spot curve is upward sloping but the spot rates are negative the par curve is above the spot curve
