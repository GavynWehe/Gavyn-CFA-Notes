- At higher rates it becomes even more convex

- Same formula as convexity adjustment but effective convexity and effective duration and change in the curve
- KRD (Key Rate Duration): Bonds price sensitivity to a change in a specific par rate

- What Are Duration and Convexity? Duration and convexity are two tools used to manage the risk exposure of fixed-income investments. **Duration measures the bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes.** **Convexity relates to the interaction between a bond's price and its yield as it experiences changes in interest rates**.
