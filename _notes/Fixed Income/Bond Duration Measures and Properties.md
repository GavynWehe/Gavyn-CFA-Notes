Yield Based Bond Duration:

- Assumes bond cash flows are certain
- Modified Duration is the first derivative from Mac Dur
- Mod Dur = Mac Dur/(1+r)
  r = Yield of the period (IE modify it for semi annual and so on)


Interpreting Mod Dur Statistic:

- ModDur of 5 = price of bond increases 5% for every 100 bps drop in yield
- Higher ModDur means more sensitive to changes in yield and a steeper curve



Approximate Modified Duration:

- Find both PV's then subtract PV- by PV+ then divide by 2 x change in yield x PVo



More changes in duration:

- Dollar Duration is a change based on dollar value
- DD = AmModDur x PVfull
- PVBP = Price value of a basis point 
- One basis point = .0001

- FRN's = floating rate notes

- As time to maturity gets closer the Mac Dur decreases so the sensitivity of the bond to changes in interest rates decreases each day as it gets closer and closer to maturity

- Since the bond resets frequently it will have a lower duration
