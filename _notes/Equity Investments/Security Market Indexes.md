- Reconstitution: taking a stock out and changing it with another



Index Weighting:
![](https://i.imgur.com/anKhmAM.png)
- Price Weighting (Simplest): Not called an index its an average. IE Dow Jones Industrial Average
- Price of the stock divided the price of all of the stocks


Price Weighting Spreadsheet:

![](https://i.imgur.com/CrXkRRW.png)
- Stock split changes the value of the weightings for price weighting
- Divisor needs to be adjusted to prevent the split from changing the value of the index



Equal Weighting:

Market Cap Weighted Index:
![](https://i.imgur.com/kFofoMZ.png)
- Divide the market cap by the sum of all market caps
- FLOAT adjusted market cap weighting: # of shares available to the investing public
- Most market cap weighted indicies are float adjusted

Market Cap With Float:

- When you change it to float adjusted you need to change the divisor as well




Market Cap Weighting Pros and Cons:
![](https://i.imgur.com/Xt7o2RJ.png)
- Still takes into account price, so may be overweighting overvalued stocks and underweighting undervalued stocks


Fundamental Weighting:
![](https://i.imgur.com/b7gFQst.png)
- Uses a fundamental value as a proxy for size rather than market cap
- IE: Book value, revenues, CFO, earnings etc...




Fundamental Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/v3QKgOD.png)
- Contrarian investing refers to an investing strategy thatÂ **looks for profit opportunities in trades that go against current market sentiment**. For example, if the market is bullish, the contrarian investor is bearish and will look for opportunities to sell.
- Might be underweighting issues that should be higher, opposite of momentum effect


Rebalancing:
![](https://i.imgur.com/rGLJxz5.png)
- As prices drift only equal weighted needs to be rebalanced
- For market cap only need to be rebalanced to reflect mergers and acquisitions and liquidations
- Price weighted no need to rebalance since the weight of each constituent is determined by price

Reconstitution: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/OhOr2bE.png)
- Process of changing the securities in the index
- Reflect changes in the target market
- Reflect judgement of the selection committee

- Multi Market Indicies: Security market indicies from different countries

- Sector Indicies: Represent a particular sector, Finance, utilities, etc...
  Helps assess manager performance, are returns due to stock picking or sector allocation
- Style Indicies: Growth VS Value

- Price return means you do not do income in calculation
- Equal weighted you have to get all the returns individually 






![](https://i.imgur.com/rHgCEsQ.png)
- Price weighted index you can just add beginning period and ending period and do the math




![](https://i.imgur.com/7XdlXUK.png)
- Market Cap Weighted Index you can get total market cap at end - beginning / beginning



![](https://i.imgur.com/Pz3uVMe.png)
- Price weighted dont worry about how many shares, just the price of one share





![](https://i.imgur.com/cHUiu67.png)
- Value weighted need to do the price x # of shares



![](https://i.imgur.com/RxkliZH.png)
- Equal weighting gives more weight to small market cap that can outperform

- Value Tilt: Contrarian effect, overweighting undervalued securities
