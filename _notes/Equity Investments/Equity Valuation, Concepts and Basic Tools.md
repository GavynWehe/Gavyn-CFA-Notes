Intrinsic Value VS Market Value:
![](https://i.imgur.com/mpZMNIq.png)
- Goal is to find mispriced securities
- IV = Intrinsic value/fundamental value
- IV < MV = overvalued
- IV > MV = Undervalued
- Depends on confidence and time frame


Examples:

Valuation Models:
![](https://i.imgur.com/CiyNqQf.png)
- PV Model: Future cash flows needed
- Multiplier Model: Market Value or Enterprise Value Multiples
  Price is a multiple of some fundamental variable
- Asset Based Valuation Model: Estimated value of assets - estimated value of liabilities + est. value of pref. shares



Example:

Dividends and Repurchases:
![](https://i.imgur.com/19JmVdj.png)
- Dividends are declared / authorized by the board of directors



Share Repurchases:

Dividend Payments:
![](https://i.imgur.com/y1CjODw.png)
- Once they are declared you are legally obligated to do it



Present Value Models:
![](https://i.imgur.com/SyceVeF.png)
- Dividend Discount Model: D/(1+r)^t
- r is usually calculated with CAPM
  CAPM = Risk free rate + Beta(Risk of equities - Rfr)


Dividend Discount Model:

Dividend Discount Model Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/GMoqTYQ.png)
- Do all the dividends you'll be getting then discount them by what the stock price is expected to be at the end of the period as well



Dividend Discount Model With Growth:
![](https://i.imgur.com/vp1P0N8.png)
- Can find next years dividend with the growth rate
- can find R by using CAPM


Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):
![](https://i.imgur.com/659l0fo.png)
- Reflects dividend paying capacity (Useful for non dividend paying stocks)
- CFO - CFinv + Net Borrowings
- CFinv = CAPEX
- Gives other ways to get to r


Examples:
![](https://i.imgur.com/qL3sgYH.png)
- Because you use infinity in the DDM you will get similar intrinsic value with different holding periods being used



Preferred Shares:
![](https://i.imgur.com/lyKYfrs.png)
- Non callable, non convertible is a perpetuity
- Calculated by: Vo = Do/r
- if it matures it is the same as a bond solve with TVM


Example:

Gordon Growth Model:
![](https://i.imgur.com/MCAsrX9.png)
- Allows for growth / change of dividend over time
- Assumes dividends grow indefinitely at a constant rate
- Vo = (Do(1+g)^t)/(1+r)^t
- r is strictly greater than g
- Simplifies down to 
  D1/(r-g)
- r needs to be greater than g 



Gordon Growth:

Gordon Growth Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/yduEyLd.png)
- Model is VERY sensitive to changes in g
- to find g in this example set end year dividend = beginning year dividend discounted by how many years it was 


Sensitivity in Gordon Growth:
![](https://i.imgur.com/tJHoR2J.png)
- Closer that r and g are together you get higher stock prices
- If growth rate of dividend is higher than r cant use gordon growth
- Good for stable low growth dividend stocks


GGM Assumptions:

Example if Dividend Starts Later:
![](https://i.imgur.com/qJxKe4k.png)
- Need to discount both the dividend price and the expected price
- Shortcut is to do the year the dividend starts paying as next year then discount it from there


Multistage DDM:
![](https://i.imgur.com/DyTyxZv.png)
- Using different growth models to find out prices at different periods to eventually discount them back once it gets to constant growth


Solving Example Above:
![](https://i.imgur.com/wLAZAx7.png)
- Work Backwards
- Makes sense, discount by the terminal value you find from Gordons then add back the dividends discounted from the previous periods
- Won't ask this big of a question with long steps since we have 90 seconds but need to know how its calculated so you can interpret it


Model Approaches:
![](https://i.imgur.com/hJPVkuT.png)
- Make sure growth is less than (1-DPR)ROE if its more it is unsustainable growth
- You drop the amount of stages a company has the closer it gets to well established constant growth


Price Multiples:
![](https://i.imgur.com/7pBaTKk.png)
- Price Multiples: Ratios that compare the share price with some sort of monetary flow or value
- Forward values give better information



P/E and P/S Ratio:

P/CF and P/BV:

Justified P/E:

Justified P/E
![](https://i.imgur.com/jCVYhc2.png)
- Relation between interest rates and growth to P/E


Multiples Based on Comparables:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FE107DA.png)
- Law of one price: Identical assets should sell for the same price


Examples:
![](https://i.imgur.com/PjigARG.png)


Enterprise Value Multiples:
![](https://i.imgur.com/0JmzAD6.png)
- Instead of estimating the value of equity estimate the value of the enterprise
- Cost of a take over
  (Po x # of shares) + MV(Pr) + MV(Debt) - cash
- EV may be difficult to calculate for companies whose debt is not publicly traded
- Dont need to calculate



Asset Based Valuation:
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZvEblig.png)
- Not good with companies whose MV are difficult to determine or have a significant amount of intangible assets

- Gordon Growth = one growth rate

- PV models are very sensitive to r and g

- P/E from Gordon Growth is inversely related to r

- Multiples can be based off of trailing or forward data
- And other multiples
