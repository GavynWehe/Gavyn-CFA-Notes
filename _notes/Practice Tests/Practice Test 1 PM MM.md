Portfolio Management and Analysis:



![[Pasted image 20240731160632.png]]
- For risk relative to a benchmark or relative risk objectives, use tracking risk, or tracking error
- For measures of absolute risk can use variance or standard deviations of returns and value at risk


![[Pasted image 20240731160916.png]]
- General account is used conservatively to pay claims to policy holders
- Surplus account represents net assets in excess of liabilities more risky



![[Pasted image 20240731161225.png]]
- Someone requires higher returns in order to take on risk means they demand compensation for taking it on they dont seek it 
- Risk seeker takes on risk without the increase in extra return


![[Pasted image 20240731161449.png]]
- Open end funds cannot trade at premiums or discounts to NAV
- Closed end equity funds are likely to have lower cash holdings than open ended funds because they dont need to redeem shares


![[Pasted image 20240731161751.png]]
- Correlation of returns within an asset class should be higher but should be lower between assets classes 


![[Pasted image 20240731161959.png]]
- An anomaly is characterized by strategies that deliver persistent abnormal returns that are predictable
- When he recalculated results using a different measure of normal return he saw no abnormality 
- His initial results were due to his choice of asset pricing model and hence the appearance of an anomaly was an illusion



![[Pasted image 20240731162843.png]]
- Multiply Sharpe Ratio of the portfolio by Correlation and add assets in which SR is greater than what you calculate 
- SRp * CORR 
- Since .46 x .40 = .184 which is less than SRnew of .2 you select C


![[Pasted image 20240731163657.png]]
- Role of management is to plan an execute value maxing strats consistent with the boards governance guidance. The risk exposures that result from management's choice of activities should be aligned with the governing body's risk budget

- Based on CAPM or systematic risk it should earn 16.59% but is expected to return 22% so it is undervalued 


Calculation:

- Set the equation = 0 since M^2 means alpha and solve for Rm


Question 11:
![[Pasted image 20240801121650.png]]
- Value at Risk (VaR): Measure of the size of the tail of the distribution of profits on a portfolio and must contain the three key elements of a time period, an amount and a probability
- Risk of an individual security is best measured by beta


Calculation:
![[Pasted image 20240801123005.png]]
- Review
- Kind of makes sense... do CML slope + T bill rate (Standard deviation)
- Then since 150% weight you do the other 50% with the other CML slope and leave out the T bill rate
- CML = Capital Market Line


Calculation:
![[Pasted image 20240801123939.png]]
- Since the SD of the portfolio will be the SD of these two by their weights and they are equally weighted and have the same correlation it equals 15 so that shows they have the same correlation



![[Pasted image 20240801124118.png]]
- Makes sense

- Cognitive Error




![[Pasted image 20240801124558.png]]
- Risk budgeting: Means of allocating a portfolio by some risk characteristics of the investments.
- Since A does not use any risk measure only a percentage of allocation level it is wrong. Beta and duration are risk measures 



Calculation:

- Multiply systematic risk % by total risk to get return 



![[Pasted image 20240801124935.png]]
- Illusion of control cognitive error can be corrected by seeking advice education or information. 
- Endowment bias and status quo bias are both emotional and harder to correct
