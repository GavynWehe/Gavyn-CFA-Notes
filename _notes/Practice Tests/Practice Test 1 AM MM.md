- Investors in common stock are subject to double taxation. Tax paid at the corpo level on pretax income and then at the individual when profits are distributed in the form of common dividends.
- Pre tax income of 120M with a tax rate of 30% = 36M
- Dividends are paid out on after tax profits 
- 120M (1-.3) = 84M 
- 84M (.4) Payout ratio = 33.6M in dividends 
- 33.6M (.2) Tax on common dividends = 6.72M
- Tax taken from corpo level + Tax on Dividends = 36M + 6.72M = 42.72M
