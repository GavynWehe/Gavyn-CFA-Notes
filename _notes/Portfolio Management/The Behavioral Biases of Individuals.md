Cognitive Errors and Emotional Biases:
![[Pasted image 20240725131300.png]]
- Cognitive errors: Biases based on faulty cognitive reasoning
  More easily corrected than emotional biases
- Emotional Biases: Our reasoning is influenced by feelings
- Cognitive Biases First
- Belief perseverance: Tendency to cling to prior beliefs committing statistical information - processing or memory errors



Belief Perseverance Conservatism and Confirmation Bias:
![[Pasted image 20240725131434.png]]
- Conservatism: Maintain prior views or forecast by inadequately incorporating new conflicting information 
- Confirmation: People tend to look for and what confirms their beliefs and ignore or undervalue what contradicts their beliefs

Confirmation Continued and Representative Bias:
![[Pasted image 20240725131626.png]]
- Representative: Tendency to classify new information based on past experiences and classifications (Eg. Stereotyping)


Representative and Illusion of Control:
![[Pasted image 20240725131900.png]]
- Representative: Base rate neglect: categorization without considering the probability 
  Sample Size Neglect: Assume small samples are representative of populations
- Illusion of Control: People tend to believe they can control or influence outcomes when in fact they cannot


Illusion of Control and Hindsight Bias:
![[Pasted image 20240725132303.png]]
- Hindsight Bias: Seeing past events as having been predictable and reasonable to expect.
  Tend to remember our own predictions as having been more accurate 


Hindsight and Processing Errors:
![[Pasted image 20240725133103.png]]
- Processing errors: Info being processed and used illogically/irrationally 
- Anchoring and adjustment bias: When required to estimate a value with unknown magnitude people generally begin by envisioning some initial default number (The anchor) which they adjust up or down to reflect subsequent information and analysis
  Adjustment is usually insufficient (Too much weight on the anchor)


Mental Accounting Bias:
![[Pasted image 20240725133307.png]]
- Mentally dividing money into accounts that influence decision



Framing and Availability Bias:
![[Pasted image 20240725133619.png]]
- Framing: Person responds differently based on how a problem is framed. Narrow framing - focusing on one or two specific points at the expense of the whole
- Availability Bias: Estimate the probability based on how easily something comes to mind

Availability and Emotional Biases: Loss Aversion Bias:
![[Pasted image 20240725134356.png]]
- Emotional Biases: May only be possible to recognize and adapt to it rather than correct for it
- Loss Aversion: People tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to achieving gains (Losses are significantly more powerful emotions than gains)
  Risk averse in gains risk seeking in losses


Loss Aversion continued and Overconfidence:
![[Pasted image 20240725134738.png]]

- Deviations from market efficiency 
  Persistent abnormal returns that differ from zero and are predictable in direction

- Value: Value tends to outperform growth
- Halo Effect: Extending a favorable calculation of one characteristic to another
