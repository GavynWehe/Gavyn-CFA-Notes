- Want optimal capital allocation line (the line with the steepest slope)



Homogeneity of Expectations: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/JcKNKzB.png)
- Assumption that all investors have the same economic expectations
- Assumes markets are informationally efficient 


Capital Market Line:
![](https://i.imgur.com/NnTz6vf.png)
- Market: Typically includes all assets that are investable and tradable 
- Usually limited to a country's major equity index
- Capital Market Line: A capital allocation line (CAL) where the risky portfolio is the market portfolio 




CAL/CML:

- Makes sense, you are borrowing money at the risk free rate (leverage) getting a higher return based off of your portfolio which returns more than your interest payments



When borrowing is more expensive than lending:

- If the cost to borrow is higher then your return will be lower but your risk and standard deviation will be the same



Systematic and Non-Systematic Risk:
![](https://i.imgur.com/zO0TXLd.png)
- Non systematic risk is diversifiable
- Systematic Risk (Market Risk): Not diversifiable



Non Systematic Risk:
![](https://i.imgur.com/NTFPqDQ.png)
- You should not get paid for non systematic risk
- No incremental reward can be earned for taking diversifiable risk


Non Systematic Risk:
![](https://i.imgur.com/xh0n20z.png)
- Capital Market Theory: The market will expect a higher return on the investment that has a higher level of systematic risk regardless of total risk (non systematic risk is not rewarded by an efficient market )



Return Generating Models:
![](https://i.imgur.com/poLS7eV.png)
- Non systematic risk can be avoided so therefore its not rewarded 
- Securities are priced to reward systematic risk only
- securities with more systematic risk should offer a higher return




Alternatives for finding all that data:
![](https://i.imgur.com/cqYw2Ly.png)
- If we only get rewarded based on systematic risk we need some way of determining what E(R) should be 
- Begin with a known portfolio 
- Measure E(R) using historical data (benchmark for systematic risk)



Multi Factor Model:
![](https://i.imgur.com/PCrdSuh.png)
- A model that can provide an estimate of E(R)
- Research shows that the 2nd term is not very useful


Single Index Model:
![](https://i.imgur.com/xE5J1fU.png)
- Only using excess return on the market and beta because other term is not useful


Finding out the Formula for CAPM:
![](https://i.imgur.com/HN4dsef.png)
- CAPM = Rfr + (Beta)(E(Rm) - rfr)

Beta and Security Market Line:
![](https://i.imgur.com/ydcSJMw.png)
- Able to use a single security with this line instead of a whole portfolio 


Calculating Beta:

CAPM Capital Asset Pricing Model:
![](https://i.imgur.com/KedirAk.png)
- Biggest criticism is its a single period model doesnt capture investment decisions for other periods.
- Also assumes everyone has the same investment horizon


CAPM Continued Assumptions:
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ma1f3hn.png)


![](https://i.imgur.com/n7QXOgK.png)
- Capital Allocation Line: Applies only to efficient portfolios
- Security Market Line (SML):  works on individual securities and inefficient portfolios 
- SML uses beta


Example:
![](https://i.imgur.com/z9fQUqJ.png)
- T bills have no beta



Using CAPM:
![](https://i.imgur.com/gbXJL4x.png)
- Use CAPM to find r then plug into dividend growth model


Applications of CAPM and SML:
![](https://i.imgur.com/r7UeQYg.png)
- Using CAPM to find r for NPV


Portfolio Performance:
![](https://i.imgur.com/wpYHUdM.png)
- Sharpe ratio is portfolio total risk
- Treynor ratio is only the systematic risk (Beta)

Sharpe Ratio VS Treynor Ratio:
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZpqgFF3.png)


Example Above On Graphs:
![](https://i.imgur.com/aNiK6JI.png)
- CML is for efficient portfolios only
- Sharpe ratio isnt only used for efficient portfolios only
- Treynor ratio is only suitable at measuring the performance of diversified portfolios
  Treynor ratio uses beta which is only systematic risk which you can only have in a well diversified portfolio
- USE THE ABOVE FOR EXPECTED RETURNS


M^2 and Jensens Alpha:
![](https://i.imgur.com/1X8WVPq.png)
- M^2 and Sharpe ratio measure the same (total risk)
- Jensens and Treynor measure the same (only look at systematic risk)

Security Selection with CAPM:
![](https://i.imgur.com/LX9GdlH.png)
- If above the line then you are undervalued and should buy
- Below the line is overvalued

EOCQ:


![](https://i.imgur.com/P9HZOoE.png)
- Capital Allocation Line is for portfolios 
- Security market line uses beta and is for securities 


![](https://i.imgur.com/s9G1Pbn.png)
- Higher A = more risk averse

![](https://i.imgur.com/qAjISMg.png)
- If its on the line its achievable 


![](https://i.imgur.com/PouLchk.png)
- Systematic affects all securities

- Higher sharpe ratio the better

- Jensons alpha and M^2 dont get compared to another value
