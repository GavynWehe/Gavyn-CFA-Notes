Risk:
![[Pasted image 20240725144321.png]]
- The effect of uncertainty in objectives
- Eliminating all risk is undesirable 


Risk Exposure:
![[Pasted image 20240725144610.png]]
- Exposure: How much risk we are currently taking 
  Acceptable and planned VS Unplanned and unacceptable
- Risk Management is getting rid of the risk you dont want to undertake for your risk appetite 


Risk Management:
![[Pasted image 20240725144734.png]]
- The process by which the level of risk that should be taken is compared the level of risk that is ACTUALLY being taking and brings the two into congruence 
- Not about minimizing risk, its about taking acceptable risk



Risk Management Elements:
![[Pasted image 20240725145248.png]]
- Does not prevent losses (But the losses should be acceptable losses)
- Identification
- Assessment
- Mitigation
- Monitoring



Features of Framework:
![[Pasted image 20240725145424.png]]



Risk Governance and Risk Identification and Measurement:
![[Pasted image 20240725145547.png]]
- Governance: Board of directors
- Risk Identification and measurement: Ongoing process of identifying risk exposures calculating risk metrics 



Risk Infrastructure and Policies and Processes:
![[Pasted image 20240725145706.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240725145905.png]]


Strategic Analysis/Integration:
![[Pasted image 20240725150052.png]]
- Management sets goals and provides a risk management framework
  Risk identified and measured
  Then Monitored
  Then mitigated if outside acceptable parameters (Tells upper management)


Benefits:
![[Pasted image 20240725150141.png]]


Risk Governance:
![[Pasted image 20240725151133.png]]
- Top down process and guidance from the board


Desirable Properties:
![[Pasted image 20240725151341.png]]
- Should provide a sense of the worst loss that can be managed
- Focus should be on enterprise risk management 
  (Objectives, health, and value of the whole)


Risk Tolerance:
![[Pasted image 20240725151607.png]]
- Extent to which the entity is willing to experience losses or opportunity costs and fail to meet its objectives



![[Pasted image 20240725151820.png]]
- Once internal and external factors are identified, define dimensions of risk they are unwilling to accept




Risk Budgeting:
![[Pasted image 20240725152233.png]]
- Risk Budgeting: Quantifying and allocating tolerable risks to various activities/investments
- Risk Budgeting: Portfolio weights based on security risk
- Capital Budgeting: Portfolio weights based on security return 


Sources of Risk:
![[Pasted image 20240725152327.png]]
- Financial: Market Risk, Credit Risk


Financial and Non Financial Risk:
![[Pasted image 20240725152532.png]]
- Non financial risk: settlement risk (Herstatt risk)
  Party fails to deliver even though it has been paid



Non Financial Risk:
![[Pasted image 20240725152819.png]]


Non Financial and Individual Risk:
![[Pasted image 20240725153134.png]]
- Solvency: Running out of cash (Being un able to secure financing or of rolling over debt)
- Risk Mitigation for individuals: Insurance 


Interactions:
![[Pasted image 20240725153302.png]]
- Credit Risk can be made worse by market risk



Measures and Modifications:
![[Pasted image 20240725153454.png]]



Value at Risk (VAR):
![[Pasted image 20240725153611.png]]
- Measures financial risk across all asset classes


Measures:
![[Pasted image 20240725153805.png]]


Risk Modifications:
![[Pasted image 20240725154040.png]]
- Risk acceptance: keeping the risk exposure (may be too costly to eliminate) but using internal means to reduce fallout
- Risk transfer: Typically in the form of an insurance policy. Pay a premium, protect against a loss

____
EOCQ:


![[Pasted image 20240725154605.png]]
- Cant avoid exposure to undesirable risk 
- Cannot control returns only risk

![[Pasted image 20240725155347.png]]
- If they are more agile they can take on more risk



![[Pasted image 20240725155506.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240725155550.png]]



![[Pasted image 20240725155716.png]]
- Solvency is finding financing and debt which is a operational thing



![[Pasted image 20240725155958.png]]
- Widening bid ask spread means less liquidity and availability to sell asset for its fair value 



![[Pasted image 20240725160115.png]]
- Value at risk is a MINIMUM loss that you can get in a day
