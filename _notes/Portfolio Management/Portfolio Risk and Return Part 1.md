Holding Period Return and Arithmetic Mean:
![](https://i.imgur.com/wmBSNXl.png)
- Arithmetic Mean: No compounding


Geometric Mean:
![](https://i.imgur.com/ROxCJpG.png)
- Considers compounding


Money Weighted Return (IRR):
![](https://i.imgur.com/lR0hT9V.png)
- Accurately reflects what a specific investor earned but lacks comparability \




Time Weighted Return:

Example:

- Geometric Return: HPR^(1/t) - 1



Annualized Returns:
![](https://i.imgur.com/uMUdcd7.png)
- Just do 365 over days
- For the years: think of years as 6 month periods
  One year has two six month periods 
  1 and a half years is 3 six month periods



Weighted Return and Other Return Measures:
![[Pasted image 20240724124303.png]]
- Gross Returns: Total Return - Trading fees
  Basis for comparing manager performance
- Net return: Gross return - management/admin fees
  what the investor earns


Other Return Measures:
![[Pasted image 20240724124902.png]]
- Pre tax and after tax nominal return:
- Capital Gains: Short term and long term gains
  Long term gains have preferred tax treatment
- Income: Interest and dividends
  Pref tax treatment 
- Real Returns: 


Leveraged Returns:
![[Pasted image 20240724125113.png]]
- Gains can be magnified but so can losses
- Must account for margin loan interest



Variance and Standard Deviations:
![[Pasted image 20240724125309.png]]
- Typically dont know population so we go with sample variance and standard deviation
- Sample takes away a degree of freedom (n-1)
- Standard deviation = square root of the variance


Variance of a Portfolio of Assets:
![[Pasted image 20240724125612.png]]
- Need variance of each asset and the covariance of each asset with each other


Formulas:
![[Pasted image 20240724125741.png]]


Example:
![[Pasted image 20240724130625.png]]
- Find the return first


Expected Return VS Historical Return:
![[Pasted image 20240724130956.png]]
- Historical: Based on actually results
- Expected: based on what we think inflation is going to be, what we think the risk premium is, and what the current risk free rate is 



Risk Aversion:
![[Pasted image 20240724131222.png]]
- Risk Aversion
- Risk Seeking
- Risk Neutral


Risk Tolerance and Utility Theory:
![[Pasted image 20240724131717.png]]
- Investors derive satisfaction (utility) from particular choices (relative to others)



Risk Aversion Assumptions and Conclusions:

Varying the Level of A:
![[Pasted image 20240724132408.png]]
- A = measure of risk aversion


![[Pasted image 20240724135307.png]]



Capital Allocation Line:
![[Pasted image 20240724135815.png]]
- Represents the portfolios available to an investor



Indifference Curves + Capital Allocation Line:
![[Pasted image 20240724140257.png]]
- n is un desirable, you van move up to get higher return for same risk 
- L is unattainable 
- b and a: Indifferent a has lower return but lower risk, b has higher return but higher risk
- m is higher than n and higher than b and a


Risk Aversion:
![[Pasted image 20240724140410.png]]
- Higher A means more risk averse



Portfolio Risk:
![[Pasted image 20240724140726.png]]


Correlations less than 1:
![[Pasted image 20240724141254.png]]
- If correlation is 1 it drops out of the formula
- Lower correlation = lower risk



![[Pasted image 20240724141643.png]]


Diversification:
![[Pasted image 20240724141853.png]]
- Invest in a variety of asset classes
- Use index ETF's
- Diversify across countries
- Down own employers stock


Diversification Continued:
![[Pasted image 20240724142201.png]]
- Correlation is the key
- Add if the risk adjusted return benefits the portfolio
- Buy insurance (IE Put options)


Minimum Variance Portfolio:
![[Pasted image 20240724142730.png]]
- Entire line = Minimum variance frontier
  Contains risky assets only 
- Point Z: Global minimum variance portfolio 
- Further away we get from Z the more return but risk increases at a faster rate
- Any point below the global is inefficient 
- Point Z - D is markawitz efficient frontier 


Adding a Risk Free Asset:
![[Pasted image 20240724143720.png]]
- Optimal capital allocation line: Combination of risk free and global minimum

EOCQ:

![[Pasted image 20240724151724.png]]
- More risk averse means you need a higher return for it to be even a thought


![[Pasted image 20240724151934.png]]
- Risk neutral only looks at highest return doesnt care about risk


![[Pasted image 20240724152129.png]]
- Negative risk aversion = risk seeking choose one with the highest risk



![[Pasted image 20240724153126.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240724153220.png]]
- Below Capital allocation line means you can do better


![[Pasted image 20240724153315.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240724154234.png]]
- Make sure you know what is being asked and what to use


![[Pasted image 20240724154850.png]]
- When finding the correlation when given standard deviation set it equal to in the formula and solve for covariance 
- Then set covariance = to correlation (standard deviation1)(Standard deviation2)


![[Pasted image 20240724155133.png]]
- Do some algebra or you can plug and play the numbers in


![[Pasted image 20240724155553.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240724160020.png]]



![[Pasted image 20240724160137.png]]
- Covariance impacts volatility the most

![[Pasted image 20240724160411.png]]


![[Pasted image 20240724160628.png]]
- Optimal risky portfolio brings in risk free rates onto the frontier
- Global minimum variance portfolio has the lowest standard deviation
- Markowitz efficient frontier is the points that dominate the other points



![[Pasted image 20240724160905.png]]
- Dominant capital allocation line is the combination of the risk free asset and the optimal risky portfolio 
- If you are at higher rates of return above the frontier you are borrowing at the risk free rate to get better returns
- If you lend you are below that part on the line
