- For tariffs the importing country pays the tariffs. example: Buying handbags from Italy with a 20% tariff, the customer has to pay the 20% so they just don't buy it

- Effects of tariff on small country

- Loss in consumer surplus = ABCD
- Gain in producer surplus = A
- Government Revenue = C
- Deadweight loss = BD


Quota: Restricts the quantity of a good that can be imported (generally for a period of time)
- Raises domestic price
- Same effect as a tariff but C is now called a "Quota Rent" instead of government revenue 
- Deadweight loss = B + C + D

- Voluntary Export Restraint (VER): Imposed by the exporting country
  Done so the quota rent can be captured by exporting country

- Importing country can do import licenses so they can capture C

- Import quota has a chance to increase government revenue domestically, but tariffs are more likely
- Export subsidy, government pays to export units

- Tariff you lose B + D
- Import quota you lose B + C + D with a chance to get some of C back with selling an import license
- Voluntary Export restraint you lose B + C + D
