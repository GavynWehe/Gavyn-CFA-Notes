- Labor Force = Those with a job + those looking
- Unemployed: Those without a job but LOOKING
- Long term unemployed = 3-4 months but still looking 
- Frictionally Unemployed = natural movement from job to job

- Productivity = Output/Hours Worked
- Leading to coincident indicator

- Inflation = Sustained rise in the overall level of prices
- Inflation is a lagging indicator
- Inflation expectations is a leading indicator

- Deflation is a sustained decrease in the aggregate price level.
- Hyperinflation is a fast increase in price level
- Disinflation a decline in the rate of increase

**Measuring Inflation:**

- Measures with indexes
- Inflation Rate = (Index1/Index0) -1 
- Index = (WQ0xP1/WQ0xP0) x100
- Has some issues
- Can be fixed with hedonic pricing

- Chain Price index - Solves substitution Bias
- Fisher Index


**Example:**

- Used to get an in between of both indexes
- Fisher = Sqrt(IpxIL)
- Index L = uses quantity from Time 0 for both calculations
- Index P = uses quantity from Time 1 for both calculations

**Producer Prices:**

- Measures the prices it takes to produce goods
- Not all PPI follows over into the CPI
- Across countries most products and services are the same but the weights may be different between households
- Different Central banks use different indexes
- Nominal GDP is adjusted to a price deflator to get real GDP
- Real GDP takes into account price increases to see if there really was an increase in sales
- Inflation is a SUSTAINED raise


**Cost Push and Demand Pull:**

- Cost Push Inflation: Rising costs (Usually Wages) compel businesses to raise prices
- NAIRU: Non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment: Rate of wage increases increases (excessive wage inflation)

- Demand Pull Inflation: Way too much demand given the supply
- Monetarists: Too much money printed in the supply
