- Aggregate Output = GDP


![](https://i.imgur.com/jckr2Tc.jpeg)
- GDP includes goods PRODUCED during the measurement period, if you have inventory that wasnt sold from last period and is sold during period being measured, that does not count



**GDP Example:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/S0o6rO8.png)
- Two different approaches
- Value added looks at value added at each stage and adds them together to find GDP
- Receipts at each stage just looks at the value of the final output 


![](https://i.imgur.com/YY2NfIC.png)
- If you import goods, you subtract that value out, since we did not produce them

- Non market transactions dont count such as: Bartering, black market/illegal activities

- Real GDP measures the increase in output year to year. It takes year1 price multiplied by year2 output. More accurate measure since prices can increase while output stays the same.


**GDP Deflator:**

- Nominal GDP/Real GDP  multiplied by 100

- 113.9 is interpreted as an increase of 13.9%

- Personal Income
- Disposable income
- Personal Savings


**REMEMBER THIS: Aggregate Output = Aggregate Income = Aggregate Expenditure**

Investment and Savings:

![](https://i.imgur.com/WUvtCx7.png)
- Savings = I + (G-T) + (X-M)
- (G-T) = Fiscal Balance
- (X-M) = Trade Balance

- Aggregate Expenditure Formula = C + I + G + (X-M)
- X = Exports
- M = Imports


**Aggregate Demand:**
**Wealth Affect:**
![](https://i.imgur.com/kmJ1hHw.png)
- If price is higher, amount consumed is less
- If amount consumed is higher then he price must be lower


**Interest Rate Affect:**


![](https://i.imgur.com/Jx5wYER.jpeg)
- If price level increased aggregate demand decreases
- If price level decreases aggregate demand increases 

**Real Exchange Rate Effect:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/MtxjXXE.png)
- Prices increase then exchange rates increase. Makes domestic goods more expensive for other countries to purchase from us
- This reduces our exports, but increases our imports because foreign goods are cheaper to us because our dollar is worth more

**Aggregate Supply Curves:**

**Explaining Movements Across the Supply and Demand Curves:**





![](https://i.imgur.com/LUlA93q.png)

**Expansion:**
- Expansions have a right shift in the demand curve 
- Income is rising people are spending demand is expanding 
- Increased output with not a big change on price level
- Downward shift on the supply level
- More people wanting to buy, less supply is available

**Contraction:**
- Left shift in the demand curve
- Supply increases

**Reasons For Shifts:**
- Household Wealth: 
- Wealth effect, We feel more wealthy so we are going to spend more and save less (My investments did well so I feel wealthy)
- Aggregate demand shifts right

- Consumer and business expectation:
- Confidence increases, Marginal consumption increases and marginal investments increase
- Right shift Aggregate demand

- Capacity Utilization (Factory):
- Investment increases (AD - Right)

- Fiscal Policy:
- Government spending or taxes decreases, consumption increases (AD - Right)

- Monetary Policy:
- Money supply increases (AD - Right)

- Exchange rate:
- Fx rate decreases, Exports increase and imports decrease (AD - Right)

- Global Growth:
- Higher exports (AD - Right)

**Shifts in Short Run Aggregate Supply:**

- When considering rising wages you also need to consider productivity increases.


**Shifts in Long Run Aggregate Supply:**

- Change in AS and AD table and its effects on real GDP and price level


![](https://i.imgur.com/b0jhOyY.png)
- Already developed economies get less output from an increase compared to developing economies

- Increase in labor has a higher potential GDP growth than capital
