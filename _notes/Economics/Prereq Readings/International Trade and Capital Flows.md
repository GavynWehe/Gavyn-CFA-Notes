- Closed economy (no outside trade closed borders) = autarky = autarky prices
- Open economy = world prices

**Formulas:**

- Terms of Trade = Export Price index/Import price index
- >100 Fewer exports needed to pay for same level of imports (Terms improved)
- <100 More imports needed to pay for same level of imports (Terms Worsened)
- Balance of Payments 
  1. Current Account- Measures flow of g/s 
  2. Capital Account- Measures transfer of capital
  3. Financial Account- Records investment flows
  BOP: 1 = 2+3
  (g/s) = goods and services
