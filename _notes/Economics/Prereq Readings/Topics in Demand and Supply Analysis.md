- Elasticity and supply and demand analysis
- Px = Price
- I = Income
- Py = Price of complement or substitute product
- Negative sign on Py = complement product
- Positive sign on Px = substitute product

- Elasticity of own price Formula 
- E < 1 = Inelastic
- E = 1 = Unit elastic
- E > 1 = Elastic 
- More elastic = more sensitive to price changes

- Ei > 0 its a normal good
- Ei < 0 Inferior good, if we make more money we buy less of the good 
- Ep < 0 Complement
- Ep > 0 Substitute
