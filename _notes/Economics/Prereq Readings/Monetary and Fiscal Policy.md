**Formulas:**

- Sum of money created = new deposit/reserve requirement
- Money Multiplier = 1/res. req
- Money multiplier is faster
- Quantity theory of money: 
- MxV = PXY
- M = Quantity of money, V = velocity of money, P = Price level, Y = Real output
- PxY = Nominal GDP
- MxV = how much was exchanged
- Fisher Effect:
- Nominal Rate = Real Rate + Inflation Expectation
- IE: Rnom = Rreal + pi^e



Quantity Theory Of Money:

- Assumptions above
- Money Neutrality: If Money supply increases only Price increases

**Demand For Money:**
Want money for...
- Transactions (Pro Cyclical)
