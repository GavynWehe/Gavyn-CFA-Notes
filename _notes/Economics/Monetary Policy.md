- Policy Rate = Federal Funds Rate
- Range for rates: What central bank will lend and borrow at
  Upper Bound: Rate willing to lend at
  Lower Bound: Rate willing to borrow at
- This will make it where banking system has to give rates above and below to stay in business, way to control the interest rates

- Easy and Tight chart for Fiscal and Monetary Policy

- Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy that increases aggregate demand directly through an increase in government spending is typically called expansionary or “loose.” By contrast, **fiscal policy is often considered contractionary or “tight” if it reduces demand via lower spending**.

- Monetary Policy: In easy money policy, the interest rates are lower, therefore it is easier to borrow, thereby increasing money circulation in the economy. In the tight money policy, the interest rates are higher, therefore it is difficult to borrow and the money circulation will reduce in the economy.

- Ricardian Equivalence (Fiscal Policy): **any increase in government borrowing will be offset by additional private saving, while any decrease in government borrowing will be offset by reduced private saving**. Sometimes this theory holds true, and sometimes it does not hold true at all.
