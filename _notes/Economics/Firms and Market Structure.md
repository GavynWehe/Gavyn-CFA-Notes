**Profit:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/zpXXbnW.png)
- Accounting Profit: Total Return - Accounting costs (explicit costs)
  Includes interest exp: A = L + OE
- Economic Profit: Acct Profit - total implicit opportunity costs

- Economic Rent: Windfall, something the company did not work for
- The more inelastic the supply is the higher the potential 


![](https://i.imgur.com/RuuySaA.png)

- Perfect competition
  Firms are price takers, all face horizontal demand curves
  Firms cannot influence price


![](https://i.imgur.com/mpNEAP0.png)


- Imperfect Competition
  Individual firms can influence price
  Smaller number of firms in the market
  Only one firm = monopoly
  Firms face downward sloping demand curves
  - Price = Average Revenue = Demand curve
    Downward sloping

- Marginal Revenue = Price (P)
- Average = Average revenue (AR)
- Total = Total Revenue (TR)


**Costs:**
- Harder learning objective with all the curves, recommends going over this more. Also think about it logically first then go to the curves



![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZvsjMW.png)


- Average Fixed Costs (AFC) = TFC/Q
- Total fixed costs (TFC) = Explicit + Implicit costs

- Total Variable Cost (TVC) = VC/U x Q
  VC/U = Variable cost per unit
- Average VC (AVC) = TVC/Q

- Total Cost (TC) = TFC + TVC
- Average Total Cost (ATC) = TC/Q
- Marginal Cost (MC) = Change TC / Change Q

- AVC bottoms out before ATC does

- Curves make sense, remember what points to stay in the industry or leave

**Economies / Diseconomies of Scale:**


![](https://i.imgur.com/8atJ8oo.png)

- Short Run = at least one of the factors of production are fixes IE Tech or plant size 
- Long run = all are variable

**Short run and long run profit maxing:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/JvOZWPQ.png)

- Short Run Profit Maxing 
  Price needs to be above SRATC curve
  If it is above and intersects with MC curve you are at max profit


![](https://i.imgur.com/qEjkfvA.png)

- Long Run Profit Maxing
- Built off of multiple short run curves

**Market Structure:**


![](https://i.imgur.com/Qk3rX1N.png)
- Look at the chart to see different characteristics of each
- Perfect Competition
- Monopolistic Competition
- Oligopoly
- Monopoly

**DEMAND ANALYSIS: Perfect Comp vs Monopolistic**
![](https://i.imgur.com/ANFsyDJ.png)

- Perfect Competition Demand Curve
  Infinitely Elastic, if price change barely goes up or down demand disappears (Horizontal Line)
  - Total Revenue curve is upward linear
  - MR = AR = Demand Curve

- Monopolistic Competition Demand Curve
- Demand curve is downward sloping
- Total Revenue curve is parabolic 
- Demand Curve = Average Revenue 
- MR = Twice the slope of the demand curve

**SUPPLY ANALYSIS: Perfect VS Monopolistic**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Aj3Bspi.png)

**Perfect Competition:**

- Supply Curve is determined by the MC curve where it is above the ATC
- MR = MC

**Monopolistic Competition:**

- No well defined supply curve
- Output is determined by MR = MC 
- However price is determined by demand curve

**Optimal Price/Output Perfect Comp vs Monopolistic:**

- Long Run Equilibrium

**Oligopoly Market Structure Demand Analysis:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/hLRKhRf.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/lYGLylv.png)
- Hard to raise prices, if you do competitors stay where they are and you lose customers
- If you lower prices your competitors will and nobody wins (The customer does)

**Nash Equilibrium:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ht3ao5i.png)

- No firm can obtain a higher payoff unless all the firms change 

**Supply Market Structure Oligopoly:**

**Monopoly Supply and Demand Analysis:**

**Concentration Ratio and Herfindahl Hirschman Index:**


![](https://i.imgur.com/CXXwRYT.png)

- Concentration Ratio:
  Closer to 0 = Perfect competition
  Closer to 100 = Oligopoly/Monopoly
- Quantifies size but not market power

- Herfindahl (HHI): 
  Sum Market structure ^2 of N Largest firms
  1 = Monopoly

- Smaller players will lower costs get better tech to reach closer curve to that of the oligopoly
